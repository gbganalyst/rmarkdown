# Introduction to Rmarkdown

.w-100.lh-copy[
R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single `R` Markdown file to:
]

--

- save and execute code

--

.w-100.lh-copy[
- generate high quality document, report, presentation and dashboard that can be shared with an audience.
]

--

.w-100.lh-copy[
R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and also support multiple languages including R, Python, and SQL.

### Rmarkdown output

.w-100.lh-copy[
R Markdown supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats including `HTML`, `PDF`, `MS Word`, `Beamer`, `HTML5 slides`, `books`, `dashboards`, `shiny applications`, `scientific articles`, `websites`, and many more.

## Markdown concept

.w-100.lh-copy[
> Markdown is an easy way for non-coders to write in a format that could be easily converted into HTML. 

]

.w-100.lh-copy[
It is a plain text formatting syntax used to write content on the web and it doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type — just the essentials, using keyboard symbols you already know.

]

--

You can use markdown to make:

.pull-left[
- Headers
- Lists
- Links
- Images
- Block quotes
- LaTeX equations
]

--

.pull-right[

- Italicized text
- Bold text
- Superscripts
- Subscripts
- Tables
- Footnotes
]

# Rmarkdown concept

.w-100.lh-copy[
R Markdown file is a plain text file that has the extension `.Rmd` while an R script has the extension `.R`. RStudio automatically load `rmarkdown` package when needed.]

Rmarkdown contains three important type of contents:

**1.** YAML header surrounded by --- 

```yaml
---
title: "Introduction to R Programming Langauge"
author: "Seyi Makinde"
date: "17/4/2021"
output: html_document
---
```
---

Rmarkdown contains three important types of content:

--

**2.** Chunks of R code surrounded by <code>```</code>. 


````markdown
```{r}`r ''`
x <- 1

y <- 3

print(x+y)
```
````


You can run each code chunk by clicking the Run icon (it looks like a play button at the top of the chunk), or by pressing `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter`.

--

**3.** Text mixed with simple text formatting (**markdown**).

--

RStudio executes the code and displays the results inline with the code.
